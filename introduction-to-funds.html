            <h2 class="introduction-to-funds-text004">History of Funds</h2>
            <span>
              <span>
                ​The history of funds dates back to the 18th century,
                specifically in 1602, when the Dutch East India Company issued
                the first publicly traded shares. However, the modern fund
                industry, as we know it today, emerged in the early 20th century
                with the introduction of the mutual fund.In 1924, the
                Massachusetts Investors Trust, the first open-end mutual fund,
                was launched in the United States. This marked a significant
                milestone in the development of funds.&nbsp;
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                The concept behind mutual funds involved pooling money from
                multiple investors to create a diversified portfolio of
                securities. This approach allowed investors with limited capital
                to access a broader range of investment opportunities.The mutual
                fund industry experienced rapid growth in the following decades
                as more investors recognised the benefits of this investment
                vehicle. By pooling resources together, individuals could
                achieve greater diversification and have their investments
                professionally managed by fund managers. This allowed investors
                to participate in various asset classes, including stocks,
                bonds, and other securities, without having to individually
                select and manage each investment.
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                In the 1990s, a new type of fund called exchange-traded funds
                (ETFs) was introduced in Canada. ETFs provided investors with a
                more flexible and cost-effective way to invest in a diversified
                portfolio of securities. Like mutual funds, ETFs pool money from
                multiple investors, but they differ in the way they are bought
                and sold on stock exchanges. ETFs can be traded throughout the
                day, similar to individual stocks, whereas mutual funds are
                typically bought and sold at the end of the trading day at the
                net asset value (NAV) price.The introduction of ETFs expanded
                the options available to investors, providing them with greater
                flexibility and control over their investment strategies.&nbsp;
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                ETFs gained popularity in the 1990s and 2000s, offering
                advantages such as lower expense ratios, tax efficiency, and the
                ability to trade intraday. Today, ETFs have become a major
                segment of the fund industry, with a wide range of options
                available to investors seeking diversified investment exposure
                across various asset classes, sectors, and regions.To summarise,
                the history of funds can be traced back to the 18th century, but
                the modern fund industry emerged in the early 20th century with
                the mutual fund. The introduction of mutual funds allowed
                investors to pool their money and access diversified portfolios
                managed by professionals.&nbsp;
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                The subsequent development of ETFs in the 1990s provided
                investors with additional choices and advantages in terms of
                flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Together, mutual funds and
                ETFs have revolutionised the way individuals invest and have
                become integral components of the fund industry.

            <h2 class="introduction-to-funds-text019">What is a Fund</h2>
            <span>
              <span>
                ​A fund is a financial vehicle that allows multiple investors to
                pool their money together to create a diversified portfolio of
                assets. These assets can include stocks, bonds, or other types
                of securities. The fund is overseen and managed by a
                professional investment manager or team who are responsible for
                making investment decisions on behalf of the investors.
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                The primary objective of a fund is to generate a return on
                investment for the investors. This return can be realised
                through various means, such as capital gains from the
                appreciation in the value of the fund's assets, dividends
                received from the underlying securities, or interest payments
                from bonds or other fixed-income instruments held by the fund.
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                There are different types of funds available to investors, each
                with its own structure and characteristics. Some common types
                include open-end funds, closed-end funds, and exchange-traded
                funds (ETFs).
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                Open-end funds are the most prevalent type of fund. These funds
                issue an unlimited number of shares to investors and are
                continuously open for new investments and redemptions. Investors
                can buy and sell shares directly from the fund company at the
                net asset value (NAV) price, which represents the value of the
                fund's underlying assets divided by the number of shares
                outstanding.
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                Closed-end funds, on the other hand, have a fixed number of
                shares that are typically bought and sold on a stock exchange.
                Unlike open-end funds, closed-end funds do not issue or redeem
                shares on a daily basis. Instead, investors can buy or sell
                shares from other investors in the secondary market, and the
                price of the shares may trade at a premium or discount to the
                net asset value.
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a type of fund that combines
                features of both open-end and closed-end funds. Like closed-end
                funds, ETFs trade on stock exchanges, and their shares can be
                bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices.
                However, similar to open-end funds, ETFs can create and redeem
                shares to meet investor demand, helping to keep their share
                prices in line with the net asset value.
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                Investors can participate in funds by buying shares, which
                represent a proportional ownership interest in the fund's
                assets. These shares can be purchased either directly from the
                fund company or through a broker on an exchange. When an
                investor buys shares, their money is added to the fund's pool of
                assets. Conversely, when an investor sells shares, they receive
                the corresponding value based on the current share price.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                In summary, funds are investment vehicles that enable
                individuals to pool their money together to create diversified
                portfolios managed by professionals. These portfolios can
                consist of various assets, and the objective is to generate a
                return on investment for the investors. Funds can be structured
                as open-end funds, closed-end funds, or ETFs, offering investors
                different options for buying and selling shares. By investing in
                funds, individuals can access a broader range of investment
                opportunities and benefit from professional management
                expertise.&nbsp;

              <span class="introduction-to-funds-text048">Fund issuers</span>
              <span>
                - Typically asset management companies or financial institutions
                responsible for creating and managing investment funds. They
                design the fund's investment strategy, select the underlying
                assets, and handle the day-to-day operations of the fund. These
                issuers make decisions on portfolio composition, asset
                allocation, and investment tactics based on the fund's
                objectives. Examples of fund issuers include companies like
                BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity Investments, which offer a
                wide range of investment funds catering to different investor
                needs. Investors can range from individual retail investors to
                pension funds, endowments, and insurance companies.

              <span>
                - Individuals or institutions that provide the capital invested
                in the fund. Investors have various objectives, such as
                diversification, income generation, capital appreciation, or a
                combination of these. They buy shares in the fund, effectively
                becoming shareholders and participating in the fund's
                performance. Investors can enter or exit a fund by buying or
                selling fund shares, and they may receive periodic distributions
                such as dividends, capital gains, or interest payments from the
                fund.

                tasks of the fund. They ensure accurate accounting, reporting,
                and compliance with regulatory requirements. Fund administrators
                manage the fund's books and records, calculate net asset value
                (NAV), prepare financial statements, and provide timely reports
                to investors. They play a crucial role in maintaining
                transparency and operational efficiency for the fund. Fund
                administrators such as State Street Corporation and Northern
                Trust provide back-office services to funds, ensuring accurate

                investors. They may operate directly or through intermediaries
                like financial advisors, banks, or online platforms.
                Distributors help investors understand the features, risks, and
                potential benefits of different funds. They may provide
                educational materials, support, and guidance to investors to
                help them make informed investment decisions. Distributors may

                establish rules and standards for fund issuers, distributors,
                and administrators to safeguard investor interests and maintain
                market integrity. Regulators monitor the fund industry, conduct
                examinations, and enforce compliance to protect investors from
                fraudulent activities and ensure fair practises. Regulators can
                vary by jurisdiction but may include agencies like the U.S.
                Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Financial
                Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom.

                  Fund Entity Establishment:
                </span>
                <span>
                  Before a fund can operate, it must be legally established.
                  This typically involves setting up an entity, such as a mutual
                  fund, exchange-traded fund (ETF), hedge fund, or private
                  equity fund. The choice of entity impacts taxation, regulatory
                  oversight, and fund structure.

                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Legal Structure Selection: Fund managers must carefully choose
                  the legal structure that best aligns with their objectives and
                  investor base. Common structures include open-end funds,
                  closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts. The choice
                  influences liquidity, trading, and governance.Documentation
                  and Bylaws: Creating the legal framework for the fund involves
                  drafting the fund's governing documents and bylaws. These
                  documents outline the fund's purpose, rules, investment
                  strategies, and operating procedures. They provide the legal
                  foundation for the fund's operations.Regulatory Compliance:
                  During the fund creation process, it is essential to comply
                  with local and international regulations. This includes
                  registering with relevant regulatory authorities, such as the
                  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for U.S.-based
                  funds, and adhering to the rules and guidelines specific to
                  the fund type and jurisdiction.
